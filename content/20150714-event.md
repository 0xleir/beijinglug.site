Title: BLUG Meeting (July 2015) - Red Programming Language
Categories: Event

Nenad Rakocevic will tell us about his programming language "[red](http://www.red-lang.org/)".

[Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_%28programming_language%29) is a [homoiconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity) language similar to [Rebol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol). It is a "full stack programming language" which can be used for extremely high-level programming ([DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) and [GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)) as well as low-level programming ([operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) and [device drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver)).

We will also discuss what our new website should be like. Welcome every one join this discussion.
